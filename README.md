Hello, my name is Nekraosv Dmitriy :sunglasses::potted_plant:

I am a digital design engineer with 10 years of professional experience.

Key skills:
Verilog | SystemVeriog | Quartus | Vivado | Modelsim | Scientific Python | DSP |
| Linux | TCL/Shell scripting

Mostly interested in contributing into state-of-the-art telecommunication
technologies. Preferably, PHY-level radio transmission protocols with
challenging DSP R&D (both FPGA and VLSI implementations). As a hobbyist I
research opportunities to implement audio processing algorithms in digital
logic.

Here I have some toy repos I have made for fun and also to demonstrate some
skills. Features:
  * No junk here. Everything is published in hope of being clear and useful.
  * Although I can't imagine 'gabella' being reused, there are also a lot of
  useful parts (SPDIF transmitter, for example).
  * I will try to be in touch with anyone who is interested in any of my works.
